# Building the documentation

I'm still trying to learn sphinx and come up with a workflow for building docs.  Right now it's pretty kludgy.

- `python3 -m pip -r dev_requirements.txt`
- Download and install [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/)
- Add `/Library/TeX/texbin` to your `$PATH`
- `cd docs`
- `make html`
- `make latexpdf`
- `cp _build/latex/osxphotos.pdf .`

The `build.sh` script in the main repo directory will build the documents for you and is the preferred way to build the docs.

The following files are generated by `build.sh` and should not be directly edited:

- source/template_help.rst
- source/tutorial.rst
