OSXPhotos provides the ability to interact with and query Apple's Photos.app library on macOS. You can query the Photos library database — for example, file name, file path, and metadata such as keywords/tags, persons/faces, albums, etc. You can also easily export both the original and edited photos.

## Supported operating systems

Only works on macOS (aka Mac OS X). Tested on macOS Sierra (10.12.6) until macOS Big Sur (10.16/11.1).

| macOS Version     | macOS name | Photos.app version |
| ----------------- |------------|:-------------------|
| 10.16, 11.0-11.2  | Big Sur    | 6.0 ✅             |
| 10.15.1 - 10.15.7 | Catalina   | 5.0 ✅             |
| 10.14.5, 10.14.6  | Mojave     | 4.0 ✅             |
| 10.13.6           | High Sierra| 3.0 ✅             |
| 10.12.6           | Sierra     | 2.0 ✅             |

This package will read Photos databases for any supported version on any supported macOS version.  E.g. you can read a database created with Photos 5.0 on MacOS 10.15 on a machine running macOS 10.12 and vice versa.

Requires python >= `3.7`. 


## Installation 
If you are new to python, I recommend you to install using pipx. See other advanced options below. 

### Installation using pipx
If you aren't familiar with installing python applications, I recommend you install `osxphotos` with [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx). If you use `pipx`, you will not need to create a virtual environment as `pipx` takes care of this. The easiest way to do this on a Mac is to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

- Open `Terminal` (search for `Terminal` in Spotlight or look in `Applications/Utilities`)
- Install `homebrew` according to instructions at [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)
- Type the following into Terminal: `brew install pipx`
- Then type this: `pipx install osxphotos`
- Now you should be able to run `osxphotos` by typing: `osxphotos`

### Installation using pip
You can also install directly from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/osxphotos/):

    pip install osxphotos

### Installation from git repository
OSXPhotos uses setuptools, thus simply run:

	git clone https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos.git
	cd osxphotos
	python3 setup.py install

I recommend you create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) before installing osxphotos.

**WARNING** The git repo for this project is very large (> 1GB) because it contains multiple Photos libraries used for testing on different versions of macOS.  If you just want to use the osxphotos package in your own code, I recommend you install the latest version from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/osxphotos/) which does not include all the test libraries. If you just want to use the command line utility, you can download a pre-built executable of the latest [release](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/releases) or you can install via `pip` which also installs the command line app.  If you aren't comfortable with running python on your Mac, start with the pre-built executable or `pipx` as described above.

## Command Line Usage

This package will install a command line utility called `osxphotos` that allows you to query the Photos database.  Alternatively, you can also run the command line utility like this: `python3 -m osxphotos`


```
> osxphotos
Usage: osxphotos [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --db <Photos database path>  Specify Photos database path. Path to Photos
                               library/database can be specified using either
                               --db or directly as PHOTOS_LIBRARY positional
                               argument. If neither --db or PHOTOS_LIBRARY
                               provided, will attempt to find the library to
                               use in the following order: 1. last opened
                               library, 2. system library, 3.
                               ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary
  --json                       Print output in JSON format.
  -v, --version                Show the version and exit.
  -h, --help                   Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  about     Print information about osxphotos including license.
  albums    Print out albums found in the Photos library.
  dump      Print list of all photos & associated info from the Photos...
  export    Export photos from the Photos database.
  help      Print help; for help on commands: help <command>.
  info      Print out descriptive info of the Photos library database.
  keywords  Print out keywords found in the Photos library.
  labels    Print out image classification labels found in the Photos...
  list      Print list of Photos libraries found on the system.
  persons   Print out persons (faces) found in the Photos library.
  places    Print out places found in the Photos library.
  query     Query the Photos database using 1 or more search options; if...
```

To get help on a specific command, use `osxphotos help <command_name>`

### Command line examples

#### export all photos to ~/Desktop/export group in folders by date created

`osxphotos export --export-by-date ~/Pictures/Photos\ Library.photoslibrary ~/Desktop/export`

**Note**: Photos library/database path can also be specified using `--db` option:

`osxphotos export --export-by-date --db ~/Pictures/Photos\ Library.photoslibrary ~/Desktop/export`

#### find all photos with keyword "Kids" and output results to json file named results.json:

`osxphotos query --keyword Kids --json ~/Pictures/Photos\ Library.photoslibrary >results.json`

#### export photos to file structure based on 4-digit year and full name of month of photo's creation date:

`osxphotos export ~/Desktop/export --directory "{created.year}/{created.month}"`

(by default, it will attempt to use the system library)

#### export photos to file structure based on 4-digit year of photo's creation date and add keywords for media type and labels (labels are only awailable on Photos 5 and higher):

`osxphotos export ~/Desktop/export --directory "{created.year}" --keyword-template "{label}" --keyword-template "{media_type}"` 

#### export default library using 'country name/year' as output directory (but use "NoCountry/year" if country not specified), add persons, album names, and year as keywords, write exif metadata to files when exporting, update only changed files, print verbose ouput

`osxphotos export ~/Desktop/export --directory "{place.name.country,NoCountry}/{created.year}"  --person-keyword --album-keyword --keyword-template "{created.year}" --exiftool --update --verbose`

### Command line reference: export

`osxphotos help export`

```
Usage: osxphotos export [OPTIONS] [PHOTOS_LIBRARY]... DEST

  Export photos from the Photos database. Export path DEST is required.
  Optionally, query the Photos database using 1 or more search options; if
  more than one option is provided, they are treated as "AND" (e.g. search for
  photos matching all options). If no query options are provided, all photos
  will be exported. By default, all versions of all photos will be exported
  including edited versions, live photo movies, burst photos, and associated
  raw images. See --skip-edited, --skip-live, --skip-bursts, and --skip-raw
  options to modify this behavior.

Options:
  --db <Photos database path>     Specify Photos database path. Path to Photos
                                  library/database can be specified using either
                                  --db or directly as PHOTOS_LIBRARY positional
                                  argument. If neither --db or PHOTOS_LIBRARY
                                  provided, will attempt to find the library to

                                  library).
  --in-album                      Search for photos that are in one or more
                                  albums.
  --not-in-album                  Search for photos that are not in any albums.
  --missing                       Export only photos missing from the Photos
                                  library; must be used with --download-missing.
  --deleted                       Include photos from the 'Recently Deleted'
                                  folder.
  --deleted-only                  Include only photos from the 'Recently
                                  Deleted' folder.
  --update                        Only export new or updated files. See notes
                                  below on export and --update.
  --ignore-signature              When used with '--update', ignores file
                                  signature when updating files. This is useful
                                  if you have processed or edited exported
                                  photos changing the file signature (size &
                                  modification date). In this case, '--update'
                                  would normally re-export the processed files
                                  but with '--ignore-signature', files which
                                  exist in the export directory will not be re-
                                  exported. If used with '--sidecar', '--ignore-
                                  signature' has the following behavior: 1) if
                                  the metadata (in Photos) that went into the
                                  sidecar did not change, the sidecar will not
                                  be updated; 2) if the metadata (in Photos)
                                  that went into the sidecar did change, a new
                                  sidecar is written but a new image file is
                                  not; 3) if a sidecar does not exist for the
                                  photo, a sidecar will be written whether or
                                  not the photo file was written or updated.
  --only-new                      If used with --update, ignores any previously
                                  exported files, even if missing from the
                                  export folder and only exports new files that
                                  haven't previously been exported.
  --dry-run                       Dry run (test) the export but don't actually
                                  export any files; most useful with --verbose.
  --export-as-hardlink            Hardlink files instead of copying them. Cannot
                                  be used with --exiftool which creates copies
                                  of the files with embedded EXIF data. Note: on
                                  APFS volumes, files are cloned when exporting
                                  giving many of the same advantages as
                                  hardlinks without having to use --export-as-
                                  hardlink.
  --touch-file                    Sets the file's modification time to match
                                  photo date.
  --overwrite                     Overwrite existing files. Default behavior is
                                  to add (1), (2), etc to filename if file
                                  already exists. Use this with caution as it
                                  may create name collisions on export. (e.g. if
                                  two files happen to have the same name)
  --export-by-date                Automatically create output folders to
                                  organize photos by date created (e.g.
                                  DEST/2019/12/20/photoname.jpg).
  --skip-edited                   Do not export edited version of photo if an
                                  edited version exists.
  --skip-original-if-edited       Do not export original if there is an edited
                                  version (exports only the edited version).
  --skip-bursts                   Do not export all associated burst images in
                                  the library if a photo is a burst photo.
  --skip-live                     Do not export the associated live video
                                  component of a live photo.
  --skip-raw                      Do not export associated raw images of a
                                  RAW+JPEG pair.  Note: this does not skip raw
                                  photos if the raw photo does not have an
                                  associated jpeg image (e.g. the raw file was
                                  imported to Photos without a jpeg preview).
  --current-name                  Use photo's current filename instead of
                                  original filename for export.  Note: Starting
                                  with Photos 5, all photos are renamed upon
                                  import.  By default, photos are exported with
                                  the the original name they had before import.
  --convert-to-jpeg               Convert all non-jpeg images (e.g. raw, HEIC,
                                  PNG, etc) to JPEG upon export.  Only works if
                                  your Mac has a GPU.
  --jpeg-quality FLOAT RANGE      Value in range 0.0 to 1.0 to use with
                                  --convert-to-jpeg. A value of 1.0 specifies
                                  best quality, a value of 0.0 specifies maximum
                                  compression. Defaults to 1.0
  --download-missing              Attempt to download missing photos from
                                  iCloud. The current implementation uses
                                  Applescript to interact with Photos to export
                                  the photo which will force Photos to download
                                  from iCloud if the photo does not exist on
                                  disk.  This will be slow and will require
                                  internet connection. This obviously only works
                                  if the Photos library is synched to iCloud.
                                  Note: --download-missing does not currently
                                  export all burst images; only the primary
                                  photo will be exported--associated burst
                                  images will be skipped.
  --sidecar FORMAT                Create sidecar for each photo exported; valid
                                  FORMAT values: xmp, json, exiftool; --sidecar
                                  xmp: create XMP sidecar used by Digikam, Adobe
                                  Lightroom, etc. The sidecar file is named in
                                  format photoname.ext.xmp The XMP sidecar
                                  exports the following tags: Description,
                                  Title, Keywords/Tags, Subject (set to Keywords
                                  + PersonInImage), PersonInImage, CreateDate,
                                  ModifyDate, GPSLongitude, Face Regions
                                  (Metadata Working Group and Microsoft Photo).
                                  --sidecar json: create JSON sidecar useable by
                                  exiftool (https://exiftool.org/) The sidecar
                                  file can be used to apply metadata to the file
                                  with exiftool, for example: "exiftool
                                  -j=photoname.jpg.json photoname.jpg" The
                                  sidecar file is named in format
                                  photoname.ext.json; format includes tag groups
                                  (equivalent to running 'exiftool -G -j').
                                  --sidecar exiftool: create JSON sidecar
                                  compatible with output of 'exiftool -j'.
                                  Unlike '--sidecar json', '--sidecar exiftool'
                                  does not export tag groups. Sidecar filename
                                  is in format photoname.ext.json; For a list of
                                  tags exported in the JSON and exiftool
                                  sidecar, see '--exiftool'. See also '--ignore-
                                  signature'.
  --sidecar-drop-ext              Drop the photo's extension when naming sidecar
                                  files. By default, sidecar files are named in
                                  format 'photo_filename.photo_ext.sidecar_ext',
                                  e.g. 'IMG_1234.JPG.xmp'. Use '--sidecar-drop-
                                  ext' to ignore the photo extension. Resulting
                                  sidecar files will have name in format
                                  'IMG_1234.xmp'. Warning: this may result in
                                  sidecar filename collisions if there are files
                                  of different types but the same name in the
                                  output directory, e.g. 'IMG_1234.JPG' and
                                  'IMG_1234.MOV'.
  --exiftool                      Use exiftool to write metadata directly to
                                  exported photos. To use this option, exiftool
                                  must be installed and in the path.  exiftool
                                  may be installed from https://exiftool.org/.
                                  Cannot be used with --export-as-hardlink.
                                  Writes the following metadata:
                                  EXIF:ImageDescription, XMP:Description (see
                                  also --description-template); XMP:Title;
                                  XMP:TagsList, IPTC:Keywords, XMP:Subject (see
                                  also --keyword-template, --person-keyword,
                                  --album-keyword); XMP:PersonInImage;
                                  EXIF:GPSLatitudeRef; EXIF:GPSLongitudeRef;
                                  EXIF:GPSLatitude; EXIF:GPSLongitude;
                                  EXIF:GPSPosition; EXIF:DateTimeOriginal;
                                  EXIF:OffsetTimeOriginal; EXIF:ModifyDate (see
                                  --ignore-date-modified); IPTC:DateCreated;
                                  IPTC:TimeCreated; (video files only):
                                  QuickTime:CreationDate; QuickTime:CreateDate;
                                  QuickTime:ModifyDate (see also --ignore-date-
                                  modified); QuickTime:GPSCoordinates;
                                  UserData:GPSCoordinates.
  --exiftool-path EXIFTOOL_PATH   Optionally specify path to exiftool; if not
                                  provided, will look for exiftool in $PATH.
  --exiftool-option OPTION        Optional flag/option to pass to exiftool when
                                  using --exiftool. For example, --exiftool-
                                  option '-m' to ignore minor warnings. Specify
                                  these as you would on the exiftool command
                                  line. See exiftool docs at
                                  https://exiftool.org/exiftool_pod.html for
                                  full list of options. More than one option may
                                  be specified by repeating the option, e.g.
                                  --exiftool-option '-m' --exiftool-option '-F'.
  --exiftool-merge-keywords       Merge any keywords found in the original file
                                  with keywords used for '--exiftool' and '--
                                  sidecar'.
  --exiftool-merge-persons        Merge any persons found in the original file
                                  with persons used for '--exiftool' and '--
                                  sidecar'.
  --ignore-date-modified          If used with --exiftool or --sidecar, will
                                  ignore the photo modification date and set
                                  EXIF:ModifyDate to EXIF:DateTimeOriginal; this
                                  is consistent with how Photos handles the
                                  EXIF:ModifyDate tag.
  --person-keyword                Use person in image as keyword/tag when
                                  exporting metadata.
  --album-keyword                 Use album name as keyword/tag when exporting
                                  metadata.
  --keyword-template TEMPLATE     For use with --exiftool, --sidecar; specify a
                                  template string to use as keyword in the form
                                  '{name,DEFAULT}' This is the same format as
                                  --directory.  For example, if you wanted to
                                  add the full path to the folder and album
                                  photo is contained in as a keyword when
                                  exporting you could specify --keyword-template
                                  "{folder_album}" You may specify more than one
                                  template, for example --keyword-template
                                  "{folder_album}" --keyword-template
                                  "{created.year}". See '--replace-keywords' and
                                  Templating System below.
  --replace-keywords              Replace keywords with any values specified
                                  with --keyword-template. By default,
                                  --keyword-template will add keywords to any
                                  keywords already associated with the photo.
                                  If --replace-keywords is specified, values
                                  from --keyword-template will replace any
                                  existing keywords instead of adding additional
                                  keywords.
  --description-template TEMPLATE
                                  For use with --exiftool, --sidecar; specify a
                                  template string to use as description in the
                                  form '{name,DEFAULT}' This is the same format
                                  as --directory.  For example, if you wanted to
                                  append 'exported with osxphotos on [today's
                                  date]' to the description, you could specify
                                  --description-template "{descr} exported with
                                  osxphotos on {today.date}" See Templating
                                  System below.
  --finder-tag-template TEMPLATE  Set MacOS Finder tags to TEMPLATE. These tags
                                  can be searched in the Finder or Spotlight
                                  with 'tag:tagname' format. For example, '--
                                  finder-tag-template "{label}"' to set Finder
                                  tags to photo labels. You may specify multiple
                                  TEMPLATE values by using '--finder-tag-
                                  template' multiple times. See also '--finder-
                                  tag-keywords and Extended Attributes below.'.
  --finder-tag-keywords           Set MacOS Finder tags to keywords; any
                                  keywords specified via '--keyword-template', '
                                  --person-keyword', etc. will also be used as
                                  Finder tags. See also '--finder-tag-template
                                  and Extended Attributes below.'.
  --xattr-template ATTRIBUTE TEMPLATE
                                  Set extended attribute ATTRIBUTE to TEMPLATE
                                  value. Valid attributes are: 'authors',
                                  'comment', 'copyright', 'description',
                                  'findercomment', 'headline', 'keywords'. For
                                  example, to set Finder comment to the photo's
                                  title and description: '--xattr-template
                                  findercomment "{title}; {descr}" See Extended
                                  Attributes below for additional details on
                                  this option.
  --directory DIRECTORY           Optional template for specifying name of
                                  output directory in the form '{name,DEFAULT}'.
                                  See below for additional details on templating
                                  system.
  --filename FILENAME             Optional template for specifying name of
                                  output file in the form '{name,DEFAULT}'. File
                                  extension will be added automatically--do not
                                  include an extension in the FILENAME template.
                                  See below for additional details on templating
                                  system.
  --jpeg-ext EXTENSION            Specify file extension for JPEG files. Photos
                                  uses .jpeg for edited images but many images
                                  are imported with .jpg or .JPG which can
                                  result in multiple different extensions used
                                  for JPEG files upon export.  Use --jpeg-ext to
                                  specify a single extension to use for all
                                  exported JPEG images. Valid values are jpeg,
                                  jpg, JPEG, JPG; e.g. '--jpeg-ext jpg' to use
                                  '.jpg' for all JPEGs.
  --strip                         Optionally strip leading and trailing
                                  whitespace from any rendered templates. For
                                  example, if --filename template is "{title,}
                                  {original_name}" and image has no title,
                                  resulting file would have a leading space but
                                  if used with --strip, this will be removed.
  --edited-suffix SUFFIX          Optional suffix template for naming edited
                                  photos.  Default name for edited photos is in
                                  form 'photoname_edited.ext'. For example, with
                                  '--edited-suffix _bearbeiten', the edited
                                  photo would be named
                                  'photoname_bearbeiten.ext'.  The default
                                  suffix is '_edited'. Multi-value templates
                                  (see Templating System) are not permitted with
                                  --edited-suffix.
  --original-suffix SUFFIX        Optional suffix template for naming original
                                  photos.  Default name for original photos is
                                  in form 'filename.ext'. For example, with '--
                                  original-suffix _original', the original photo
                                  would be named 'filename_original.ext'.  The
                                  default suffix is '' (no suffix). Multi-value
                                  templates (see Templating System) are not
                                  permitted with --original-suffix.
  --use-photos-export             Force the use of AppleScript or PhotoKit to
                                  export even if not missing (see also '--
                                  download-missing' and '--use-photokit').
  --use-photokit                  Use with '--download-missing' or '--use-
                                  photos-export' to use direct Photos interface
                                  instead of AppleScript to export. Highly
                                  experimental alpha feature; does not work with
                                  iTerm2 (use with Terminal.app). This is faster
                                  and more reliable than the default AppleScript
                                  interface.
  --report <path to export report>
                                  Write a CSV formatted report of all files that
                                  were exported.
  --cleanup                       Cleanup export directory by deleting any files
                                  which were not included in this export set.
                                  For example, photos which had previously been
                                  exported and were subsequently deleted in
                                  Photos.
  --exportdb EXPORTDB_FILE        Specify alternate name for database file which
                                  stores state information for export and
                                  --update. If --exportdb is not specified,
                                  export database will be saved to
                                  '.osxphotos_export.db' in the export
                                  directory.  Must be specified as filename
                                  only, not a path, as export database will be
                                  saved in export directory.
  --load-config <config file path>
                                  Load options from file as written with --save-
                                  config. This allows you to save a complex
                                  export command to file for later reuse. For
                                  example: 'osxphotos export <lots of options
                                  here> --save-config osxphotos.toml' then
                                  'osxphotos export /path/to/export --load-
                                  config osxphotos.toml'. If any other command
                                  line options are used in conjunction with
                                  --load-config, they will override the
                                  corresponding values in the config file.
  --save-config <config file path>
                                  Save options to file for use with --load-
                                  config. File format is TOML.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.

** Export **

When exporting photos, osxphotos creates a database in the top-level export
folder called '.osxphotos_export.db'.  This database preserves state information
used for determining which files need to be updated when run with --update.  It
is recommended that if you later move the export folder tree you also move the
database file.

The --update option will only copy new or updated files from the library to the
export folder.  If a file is changed in the export folder (for example, you
edited the exported image), osxphotos will detect this as a difference and re-
export the original image from the library thus overwriting the changes.  If
using --update, the exported library should be treated as a backup, not a
working copy where you intend to make changes. If you do edit or process the
exported files and do not want them to be overwritten withsubsequent --update,
use --ignore-signature which will match filename but not file signature when
exporting.

Note: The number of files reported for export and the number actually exported
may differ due to live photos, associated raw images, and edited photos which
are reported in the total photos exported.

Implementation note: To determine which files need to be updated, osxphotos
stores file signature information in the '.osxphotos_export.db' database. The
signature includes size, modification time, and filename.  In order to minimize
run time, --update does not do a full comparison (diff) of the files nor does it
compare hashes of the files.  In normal usage, this is sufficient for updating
the library. You can always run export without the --update option to re-export
the entire library thus rebuilding the '.osxphotos_export.db' database.


** Extended Attributes **

Some options (currently '--finder-tag-template', '--finder-tag-keywords',
'-xattr-template') write additional metadata to extended attributes in the file.
These options will only work if the destination filesystem supports extended
attributes (most do). For example, --finder-tag-keyword writes all keywords
(including any specified by '--keyword-template' or other options) to Finder
tags that are searchable in Spotlight using the syntax: 'tag:tagname'. For
example, if you have images with keyword "Travel" then using '--finder-tag-
keywords' you could quickly find those images in the Finder by typing
'tag:Travel' in the Spotlight search bar. Finder tags are written to the
'com.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags' extended attribute. Unlike EXIF metadata,
extended attributes do not modify the actual file. Most cloud storage services
do not synch extended attributes. Dropbox does sync them and any changes to a
file's extended attributes will cause Dropbox to re-sync the files.

The following attributes may be used with '--xattr-template':


authors        The author, or authors, of the contents of the file.  A list of
               strings. (com.apple.metadata:kMDItemAuthors)
comment        A comment related to the file.  This differs from the Finder
               comment, kMDItemFinderComment.  A string.
               (com.apple.metadata:kMDItemComment)
copyright      The copyright owner of the file contents.  A string.
               (com.apple.metadata:kMDItemCopyright)
description    A description of the content of the resource.  The description
               may include an abstract, table of contents, reference to a
               graphical representation of content or a free-text account of
               the content.  A string. (com.apple.metadata:kMDItemDescription)
findercomment  Finder comments for this file.  A string.
               (com.apple.metadata:kMDItemFinderComment)
headline       A publishable entry providing a synopsis of the contents of the
               file.  A string. (com.apple.metadata:kMDItemHeadline)
keywords       Keywords associated with this file. For example, “Birthday”,
               “Important”, etc. This differs from Finder tags
               (_kMDItemUserTags) which are keywords/tags shown in the Finder
               and searchable in Spotlight using "tag:tag_name".  A list of
               strings. (com.apple.metadata:kMDItemKeywords)

** Templating System **

The templating system converts one or template statements, written in osxphotos 
templating language, to one or more rendered values using information from the  
photo being processed.                                                          

In its simplest form, a template statement has the form: "{template_field}", for
example "{title}" which would resolve to the title of the photo.                

Template statements may contain one or more modifiers.  The full syntax is:     

"pretext{delim+template_field:subfield|filter(path_sep)[find,replace]?bool_value
,default}posttext"                                                              

Template statements are white-space sensitive meaning that white space (spaces, 
tabs) changes the meaning of the template statement.                            

pretext and posttext are free form text.  For example, if a photo has title "My 
Photo Title". the template statement "The title of the photo is {title}",       
resolves to "The title of the photo is My Photo Title".  The pretext in this    
example is "The title if the photo is " and the template_field is {title}.      

delim: optional delimiter string to use when expanding multi-valued template    
values in-place                                                                 

+: If present before template name, expands the template in place.  If delim not
provided, values are joined with no delimiter.                                  

e.g. if Photo keywords are ["foo","bar"]:                                       

 • "{keyword}" renders to "foo", "bar"                                          
 • "{,+keyword}" renders to: "foo,bar"                                          
 • "{; +keyword}" renders to: "foo; bar"                                        
 • "{+keyword}" renders to "foobar"                                             

template_field: The template field to resolve.  See Template Substitutions for  
full list of template fields.                                                   

:subfield: Some templates have sub-fields, For example, {exiftool:IPTC:Make};   
the template_field is exiftool and the sub-field is IPTC:Make.                  

|filter: You may optionally append one or more filter commands to the end of the
template field using the vertical pipe ('|') symbol.  Filters may be combined,  
separated by '|' as in: {keyword|capitalize|parens}.                            

Valid filters are:                                                              

 • lower: Convert value to lower case, e.g. 'Value' => 'value'.                 
 • upper: Convert value to upper case, e.g. 'Value' => 'VALUE'.                 
 • strip: Strip whitespace from beginning/end of value, e.g. ' Value ' =>       
   'Value'.                                                                     
 • titlecase: Convert value to title case, e.g. 'my value' => 'My Value'.       
 • capitalize: Capitalize first word of value and convert other words to lower  
   case, e.g. 'MY VALUE' => 'My value'.                                         
 • braces: Enclose value in curly braces, e.g. 'value => '{value}'.             
 • parens: Enclose value in parentheses, e.g. 'value' => '(value')              
 • brackets: Enclose value in brackets, e.g. 'value' => '[value]'               

e.g. if Photo keywords are ["FOO","bar"]:                                       

 • "{keyword|lower}" renders to "foo", "bar"                                    
 • "{keyword|upper}" renders to: "FOO", "BAR"                                   
 • "{keyword|capitalize}" renders to: "Foo", "Bar"                              
 • "{keyword|lower|parens}" renders to: "(foo)", "(bar)"                        

e.g. if Photo description is "my description":                                  

 • "{descr|titlecase}" renders to: "My Description"                             

(path_sep): optional path separator to use when joining path-like fields, for   
example {folder_album}.  Default is "/".                                        

e.g. If Photo is in Album1 in Folder1:                                          

 • "{folder_album}" renders to ["Folder1/Album1"]                               
 • "{folder_album(>)}" renders to ["Folder1>Album1"]                            
 • "{folder_album()}" renders to ["Folder1Album1"]                              

[find|replace]: optional text replacement to perform on rendered template value.
For example, to replace "/" in an album name, you could use the template        
"{album[/,-]}".  Multiple replacements can be made by appending "|" and adding  
another find|replace pair.  e.g. to replace both "/" and ":" in album name:     
"{album[/,-|:,-]}".  find/replace pairs are not limited to single characters.   
The "|" character cannot be used in a find/replace pair.                        

?bool_value: Template fields may be evaluated as boolean by appending "?" after 
the field name (and following "(path_sep)" or "[find/replace]".  If a field is  
True (e.g. photo is HDR and field is "{hdr}") or has any value, the value       
following the "?" will be used to render the template instead of the actual     
field value.  If the template field evaluates to False (e.g. in above example,  
photo is not HDR) or has no value (e.g. photo has no title and field is         
"{title}") then the default value following a "," will be used.                 

e.g. if photo is an HDR image,                                                  

 • "{hdr?ISHDR,NOTHDR}" renders to "ISHDR"                                      

and if it is not an HDR image,                                                  

 • "{hdr?ISHDR,NOTHDR}" renders to "NOTHDR"                                     

,default: optional default value to use if the template name has no value.  This
modifier is also used for the value if False for boolean-type fields (see above)
as well as to hold a sub-template for values like {created.strftime}.  If no    
default value provided, "_" is used.                                            

e.g., if photo has no title set,                                                

 • "{title}" renders to "_"                                                     
 • "{title,I have no title}" renders to "I have no title"                       

Template fields such as created.strftime use the default value to pass the      
template to use for strftime.                                                   

e.g., if photo date is 4 February 2020, 19:07:38,                               

 • "{created.strftime,%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S}" renders to "2020-02-04-190738"          

Some template fields such as "{media_type}" use the default value to allow      
customization of the output. For example, "{media_type}" resolves to the special
media type of the photo such as panorama or selfie.  You may use the default    
value to override these in form:                                                
"{media_type,video=vidéo;time_lapse=vidéo_accélérée}". In this example, if photo
was a time_lapse photo, media_type would resolve to vidéo_accélérée instead of  
time_lapse.                                                                     

Either or both bool_value or default (False value) may be empty which would     
result in empty string "" when rendered.                                        

If you want to include "{" or "}" in the output, use "{openbrace}" or           
"{closebrace}" template substitution.                                           

e.g. "{created.year}/{openbrace}{title}{closebrace}" would result in            
"2020/{Photo Title}".                                                           

With the --directory and --filename options you may specify a template for the
export directory or filename, respectively. The directory will be appended to
the export path specified in the export DEST argument to export.  For example,
if template is '{created.year}/{created.month}', and export destination DEST is
'/Users/maria/Pictures/export', the actual export directory for a photo would be
'/Users/maria/Pictures/export/2020/March' if the photo was created in March
2020.

The templating system may also be used with the --keyword-template option to set
keywords on export (with --exiftool or --sidecar), for example, to set a new
keyword in format 'folder/subfolder/album' to preserve the folder/album
structure, you can use --keyword-template "{folder_album}" or in the
'folder>subfolder>album' format used in Lightroom Classic, --keyword-template
"{folder_album(>)}".

In the template, valid template substitutions will be replaced by the
corresponding value from the table below.  Invalid substitutions will result in
a an error and the script will abort.

## Package Interface

### PhotosDB

#### Read a Photos library database

```python
osxphotos.PhotosDB()
osxphotos.PhotosDB(path)
osxphotos.PhotosDB(dbfile=path)
```

Reads the Photos library database and returns a PhotosDB object.  

Pass the path to a Photos library or to a specific database file (e.g. "/Users/smith/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary" or "/Users/smith/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/database/photos.db").  Normally, it's recommended you pass the path the .photoslibrary folder, not the actual database path.  **Note**: In Photos, users may specify a different library to open by holding down the *option* key while opening Photos.app. See also [get_last_library_path](#get_last_library_path) and [get_system_library_path](#get_system_library_path)

If an invalid path is passed, PhotosDB will raise `FileNotFoundError` exception.

**Note**: If neither path or dbfile is passed, PhotosDB will use get_last_library_path to open the last opened Photos library.  This usually works but is not 100% reliable.  It can also lead to loading a different library than expected if the user has held down *option* key when opening Photos to switch libraries.  You may therefore want to explicitely pass the path to `PhotosDB()`. 

#### Open the default (last opened) Photos library

The default library is the library that would open if the user opened Photos.app.

```python
import osxphotos
photosdb = osxphotos.PhotosDB(osxphotos.utils.get_last_library_path())
```

#### Open System Photos library

In Photos 5 (Catalina / MacOS 10.15), you can use `get_system_library_path()` to get the path to the System photo library if you want to ensure PhotosDB opens the system library.  This does not work on older versions of MacOS. E.g.

```python
import osxphotos

path = osxphotos.get_system_library_path()
photosdb = osxphotos.PhotosDB(path)
```

also,

```python
import osxphotos

path = osxphotos.get_system_library_path()
photosdb = osxphotos.PhotosDB(dbfile=path)
```

#### Open a specific Photos library
```python
import osxphotos

photosdb = osxphotos.PhotosDB(dbfile="/Users/smith/Pictures/Test.photoslibrary/database/photos.db")
```

or

```python
import osxphotos

photosdb = osxphotos.PhotosDB("/Users/smith/Pictures/Test.photoslibrary")
```

Pass the fully qualified path to the Photos library or the actual database file inside the library. The database is called photos.db and resides in the database folder in your Photos library.  If you pass only the path to the library, PhotosDB will add the database path automatically.  The option to pass the actual database path is provided so database files can be queried even if separated from the actual .photoslibrary file. 

Returns a PhotosDB object. 

**Note**: If you have a large library (e.g. many thousdands of photos), creating the PhotosDB object can take a long time (10s of seconds).  See [Implementation Notes](#implementation-notes) for additional details. 

#### `keywords`
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
keywords = photosdb.keywords
```

Returns a list of the keywords found in the Photos library

#### `album_info`
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
albums = photosdb.album_info
```

Returns a list of [AlbumInfo](#AlbumInfo) objects representing albums in the database or empty list if there are no albums.  See also [albums](#albums).

#### `albums`
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
album_names = photosdb.albums
```

Returns a list of the album names found in the Photos library.  

**Note**: In Photos 5.0 (MacOS 10.15/Catalina), It is possible to have more than one album with the same name in Photos.  Albums with duplicate names are treated as a single album and the photos in each are combined.  For example, if you have two albums named "Wedding" and each has 2 photos, osxphotos will treat this as a single album named "Wedding" with 4 photos in it.

See also [album_info](#album_info.)

#### `albums_shared`

Returns list of shared album names found in photos database (e.g. albums shared via iCloud photo sharing)

**Note**: *Only valid for Photos 5 / MacOS 10.15*; on Photos <= 4, prints warning and returns empty list.

#### `import_info`

Returns a list of [ImportInfo](#importinfo) objects representing the import sessions for the database.

#### `folder_info`
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
folders = photosdb.folder_info
```

Returns a list of [FolderInfo](#FolderInfo) objects representing top level folders in the database or empty list if there are no folders.  See also [folders](#folders).

**Note**: Currently folder_info is only implemented for Photos 5 (Catalina); will return empty list and output warning if called on earlier database versions.

#### `folders`
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
folders = photosdb.folders
```

Returns a list names of top level folder names in the database. 

**Note**: Currently folders is only implemented for Photos 5 (Catalina); will return empty list and output warning if called on earlier database versions.

#### `persons`
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
persons = photosdb.persons
```

Returns a list of the person names (faces) found in the Photos library.  **Note**: It is of course possible to have more than one person with the same name, e.g. "Maria Smith", in the database.  `persons` assumes these are the same person and will list only one person named "Maria Smith".  If you need more information about persons in the database, see [person_info](#dbpersoninfo).

#### <a name="dbpersoninfo">`person_info`</a>
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
person_info = photosdb.person_info
```

Returns a list of [PersonInfo](#personinfo) objects representing persons who appear in photos in the database. 

#### `keywords_as_dict`
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
keyword_dict = photosdb.keywords_as_dict
```

Returns a dictionary of keywords found in the Photos library where key is the keyword and value is the count of how many times that keyword appears in the library (ie. how many photos are tagged with the keyword).  Resulting dictionary is in reverse sorted order (e.g. keyword with the highest count is first).

#### `persons_as_dict`
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
persons_dict = photosdb.persons_as_dict
```

Returns a dictionary of persons (faces) found in the Photos library where key is the person name and value is the count of how many times that person appears in the library (ie. how many photos are tagged with the person).  Resulting dictionary is in reverse sorted order (e.g. person who appears in the most photos is listed first). **Note**: It is of course possible to have more than one person with the same name, e.g. "Maria Smith", in the database.  `persons_as_dict` assumes these are the same person and will list only one person named "Maria Smith".  If you need more information about persons in the database, see [person_info](#dbpersoninfo).


#### `albums_as_dict`
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
albums_dict = photosdb.albums_as_dict
```

Returns a dictionary of albums found in the Photos library where key is the album name and value is the count of how many photos are in the album.  Resulting dictionary is in reverse sorted order (e.g. album with the most photos is listed first).  

**Note**: In Photos 5.0 (MacOS 10.15/Catalina), It is possible to have more than one album with the same name in Photos.  Albums with duplicate names are treated as a single album and the photos in each are combined.  For example, if you have two albums named "Wedding" and each has 2 photos, osxphotos will treat this as a single album named "Wedding" with 4 photos in it.

#### `albums_shared_as_dict`
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
albums_shared_dict = photosdb.albums_shared_as_dict
```

Returns a dictionary of shared albums (e.g. shared via iCloud photo sharing) found in the Photos library where key is the album name and value is the count of how many photos are in the album.  Resulting dictionary is in reverse sorted order (e.g. album with the most photos is listed first).   

**Note**: *Photos 5 / MacOS 10.15 only*.  On earlier versions of Photos, prints warning and returns empty dictionary.

#### `labels`
Returns image categorization labels associated with photos in the library as list of str.

**Note**: Only valid on Photos 5; on earlier versions, returns empty list. In Photos 5, Photos runs machine learning image categorization against photos in the library and automatically assigns labels to photos such as "People", "Dog", "Water", etc.  A photo may have zero or more labels associated with it.  See also [labels_normalized](#labels_normalized).  

#### `labels_normalized`
Returns image categorization labels associated with photos in the library as list of str. Labels are normalized (e.g. converted to lower case).  Use of normalized strings makes it easier to search if you don't how Apple capitalizes a label.

**Note**: Only valid on Photos 5; on earlier versions, returns empty list. In Photos 5, Photos runs machine learning image categorization against photos in the library and automatically assigns labels to photos such as "People", "Dog", "Water", etc.  A photo may have zero or more labels associated with it.  See also [labels](#labels).  

#### `labels_as_dict`
Returns dictionary image categorization labels associated with photos in the library where key is label and value is number of photos in the library with the label.

**Note**: Only valid on Photos 5; on earlier versions, logs warning and returns empty dict. In Photos 5, Photos runs machine learning image categorization against photos in the library and automatically assigns labels to photos such as "People", "Dog", "Water", etc.  A photo may have zero or more labels associated with it.  See also [labels_normalized_as_dict](#labels_normalized_as_dict).  

#### `labels_normalized_as_dict`
Returns dictionary of image categorization labels associated with photos in the library where key is normalized label and value is number of photos in the library with that label. Labels are normalized (e.g. converted to lower case).  Use of normalized strings makes it easier to search if you don't how Apple capitalizes a label.

**Note**: Only valid on Photos 5; on earlier versions, logs warning and returns empty dict. In Photos 5, Photos runs machine learning image categorization against photos in the library and automatically assigns labels to photos such as "People", "Dog", "Water", etc.  A photo may have zero or more labels associated with it.  See also [labels_as_dict](#labels_as_dict).  




#### `library_path`
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
photosdb.library_path
```

Returns the path to the Photos library as a string

#### `db_path`
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
photosdb.db_path
```

Returns the path to the Photos database PhotosDB was initialized with

#### `db_version`
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
photosdb.db_version
```

Returns the version number for Photos library database.  You likely won't need this but it's provided in case needed for debugging. PhotosDB will print a warning to `sys.stderr` if you open a database version that has not been tested. 

#### `get_db_connection()`
Returns tuple of (connection, cursor) for the working copy of the Photos database.  This is useful for debugging or prototyping new features.

```python
photosdb = osxphotos.PhotosDB()
conn, cursor = photosdb.get_db_connection()

results = conn.execute(
        "SELECT ZUUID FROM ZGENERICASSET WHERE ZFAVORITE = 1;"
).fetchall()

for row in results:
    # do something
    pass

conn.close()
```
#### <A name="photos">`photos(keywords=None, uuid=None, persons=None, albums=None, images=True, movies=True, from_date=None, to_date=None, intrash=False)`</a>

```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
photos = photosdb.photos([keywords=['keyword',]], [uuid=['uuid',]], [persons=['person',]], [albums=['album',]],[from_date=datetime.datetime],[to_date=datetime.datetime])
```

Returns a list of [PhotoInfo](#PhotoInfo) objects.  Each PhotoInfo object represents a photo in the Photos Libary.

If called with no parameters, returns a list of every photo in the Photos library. 

May be called with one or more of the following parameters:
```python
photos = photosdb.photos(
    keywords = [],
    uuid = [],
    persons = [],
    albums = [],
    images = bool,
    movies = bool,
    from_date = datetime.datetime,
    to_date = datetime.datetime,
    intrash = bool,
)
```

- ```keywords```: list of one or more keywords.  Returns only photos containing the keyword(s).  If more than one keyword is provided finds photos matching any of the keywords (e.g. treated as "or")
- ```uuid```: list of one or more uuids.  Returns only photos whos UUID matches.  **Note**: The UUID is the universally unique identifier that the Photos database uses to identify each photo.  You shouldn't normally need to use this but it is a way to access a specific photo if you know the UUID.  If more than more uuid is provided, returns photos that match any of the uuids (e.g. treated as "or")
- ```persons```: list of one or more persons. Returns only photos containing the person(s).  If more than one person provided, returns photos that match any of the persons (e.g. treated as "or")
- ```albums```: list of one or more album names.  Returns only photos contained in the album(s). If more than one album name is provided, returns photos contained in any of the albums (.e.g. treated as "or")
- ```images```: bool; if True, returns photos/images; default is True
- ```movies```: bool; if True, returns movies/videos; default is True 
- ```from_date```: datetime.datetime; if provided, finds photos where creation date >= from_date; default is None
- ```to_date```: datetime.datetime; if provided, finds photos where creation date <= to_date; default is None
- ```intrash```: if True, finds only photos in the "Recently Deleted" or trash folder, if False does not find any photos in the trash; default is False

See also [get_photo()](#getphoto) which is much faster for retrieving a single photo.

If more than one of (keywords, uuid, persons, albums,from_date, to_date) is provided, they are treated as "and" criteria. E.g.

Finds all photos with (keyword = "wedding" or "birthday") and (persons = "Juan Rodriguez")

```python
photos=photosdb.photos(keywords=["wedding","birthday"],persons=["Juan Rodriguez"])
```

Find all photos tagged with keyword "wedding":
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
photos = photosdb.photos(keywords=["wedding"])
 ```

Find all photos of Maria Smith
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
photos=photosdb.photos(persons=["Maria Smith"])
```

Find all photos in album "Summer Vacation" or album "Ski Trip"
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
photos=photosdb.photos(albums=["Summer Vacation", "Ski Trip"])
```

Find the single photo with uuid = "osMNIO5sQFGZTbj9WrydRB"
```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
photos=photosdb.photos(uuid=["osMNIO5sQFGZTbj9WrydRB"])
```

If you need to do more complicated searches, you can do this programmaticaly.  For example, find photos with keyword = "Kids" but not in album "Vacation 2019" 

```python
# assumes photosdb is a PhotosDB object (see above)
photos1 = photosdb.photos(albums=["Vacation 2019"])
photos2 = photosdb.photos(keywords=["Kids"])
photos3 = [p for p in photos2 if p not in photos1]
```

To get only movies:
```python
movies = photosdb.photos(images=False, movies=True)
```

**Note** PhotosDB.photos() may return a different number of photos than Photos.app reports in the GUI. This is because photos() returns [hidden](#hidden) photos, [shared](#shared) photos, and for [burst](#burst) photos, all selected burst images even if non-selected burst images have not been deleted. Photos only reports 1 single photo for each set of burst images until you "finalize" the burst by selecting key photos and deleting the others using the "Make a selection" option. 

For example, in my library, Photos says I have 19,386 photos and 474 movies.  However, PhotosDB.photos() reports 25,002 photos.  The difference is due to 5,609 shared photos and 7 hidden photos.  (*Note* Shared photos only valid for Photos 5).  Similarly, filtering for just movies returns 625 results.  The difference between 625 and 474 reported by Photos is due to 151 shared movies.

```pycon
>>> import osxphotos
>>> photosdb = osxphotos.PhotosDB("/Users/smith/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary")
>>> photos = photosdb.photos()
>>> len(photos)
25002
>>> shared = [p for p in photos if p.shared]
>>> len(shared)
5609
>>> not_shared = [p for p in photos if not p.shared]
>>> len(not_shared)
19393
>>> hidden = [p for p in photos if p.hidden]
>>> len(hidden)
7
>>> movies = photosdb.photos(movies=True, images=False)
>>> len(movies)
625
>>> shared_movies = [m for m in movies if m.shared]
>>> len(shared_movies)
151
>>>
```

#### <a name="getphoto">`get_photo(uuid)`</A>
Returns a single PhotoInfo instance for photo with UUID matching `uuid` or None if no photo is found matching `uuid`.  If you know the UUID of a photo, `get_photo()` is much faster than `photos`.  See also [photos()](#photos).


### PhotoInfo 
PhotosDB.photos() returns a list of PhotoInfo objects.  Each PhotoInfo object represents a single photo in the Photos library.

#### `uuid`

#### `original_filename`
Returns the original filename of the photo when it was imported to Photos.  **Note**: Photos 5.0+ renames the photo when it adds the file to the library using UUID.  See also [filename](#filename)

#### `date`
Returns the create date of the photo as a datetime.datetime object

#### `date_modified`
Returns the modification date of the photo as a datetime.datetime object or None if photo has no modification date

#### `description`

#### `albums`
Returns a list of albums the photo is contained in. See also [album_info](#album_info).

#### `album_info`
Returns a list of [AlbumInfo](#AlbumInfo) objects representing the albums the photo is contained in.  See also [albums](#albums).

#### `import_info`
Returns an [ImportInfo](#importinfo) object representing the import session associated with the photo or `None` if there is no associated import session.

#### `persons`
Returns a list of the names of the persons in the photo

#### <a name="photopersoninfo">`person_info`</a>
Returns a list of [PersonInfo](#personinfo) objects representing persons in the photo.  Each PersonInfo object is associated with one or more FaceInfo objects.

#### <a name="photofaceinfo">`face_info`</a>
Returns a list of [FaceInfo](#faceinfo) objects representing faces in the photo.  Each face is associated with the a PersonInfo object.

#### `path`
Returns the absolute path to the photo on disk as a string.  **Note**: this returns the path to the *original* unedited file (see [hasadjustments](#hasadjustments)).  If the file is missing on disk, path=`None` (see [ismissing](#ismissing)).

#### `path_edited`
Returns the absolute path to the edited photo on disk as a string.  If the photo has not been edited, returns `None`.  See also [path](#path) and [hasadjustments](#hasadjustments).  

**Note**: will also return None if the edited photo is missing on disk. 

#### `path_raw`
Returns the absolute path to the associated raw photo on disk as a string, if photo is part of a RAW+JPEG pair, otherwise returns None.  See [notes on Raw Photos](#raw-photos).

#### `has_raw`
Returns True if photo has an associated raw image, otherwise False. (e.g. Photo is a RAW+JPEG pair). See also [is_raw](#israw) and [notes on Raw Photos](#raw-photos).

#### `israw`
Returns True if photo is a raw image. E.g. it was imported as a single raw image, not part of a RAW+JPEG pair.  See also [has_raw](#has_raw) and .

#### `raw_original`
Returns True if associated raw image and the raw image is selected in Photos via "Use RAW as Original", otherwise returns False.  See [notes on Raw Photos](#raw-photos).

#### `height`
Returns height of the photo in pixels.  If image has been edited, returns height of the edited image, otherwise returns height of the original image.  See also [original_height](#original_height).

#### `width`
Returns width of the photo in pixels.  If image has been edited, returns width of the edited image, otherwise returns width of the original image.  See also [original_width](#original_width).

#### `orientation`
Returns EXIF orientation value of the photo as integer.  If image has been edited, returns orientation of the edited image, otherwise returns orientation of the original image. See also [original_orientation](#original_orientation).  If orientation cannot be determined, returns 0 (this happens if osxphotos cannot decode the adjustment info for an edited image).

#### `original_height`
Returns height of the original photo in pixels. See also [height](#height).

#### `original_width`
Returns width of the original photo in pixels. See also [width](#width). 

#### `original_orientation`

#### `original_filesize`
Returns size of the original photo in bytes as integer.

#### `ismissing`
Returns `True` if the original image file is missing on disk, otherwise `False`.  This can occur if the file has been uploaded to iCloud but not yet downloaded to the local library or if the file was deleted or imported from a disk that has been unmounted and user hasn't enabled "Copy items to the Photos library" in Photos preferences. **Note**: this status is computed based on data in the Photos library and `ismissing` does not verify if the photo is actually missing. See also [path](#path).

#### `hasadjustments`
Returns `True` if the picture has been edited, otherwise `False`

#### `adjustments`
On Photos 5+, returns an [AdjustmentsInfo](#adjustmentsinfo) object representing the adjustments (edits) to the photo or None if there are no adjustments.  On earlier versions of Photos, always returns None.

#### `external_edit`
Returns `True` if the picture was edited in an external editor (outside Photos.app), otherwise `False`

#### `favorite`
Returns `True` if the picture has been marked as a favorite, otherwise `False`

#### `hidden`
Returns `True` if the picture has been marked as hidden, otherwise `False`

#### `visible`
Returns `True` if the picture is visible in library, otherwise `False`.  e.g. non-selected burst photos are not hidden but also not visible

#### `intrash`
Returns `True` if the picture is in the trash ('Recently Deleted' folder), otherwise `False`

#### `date_trashed`
Returns the date the photo was placed in the trash as a datetime.datetime object or None if photo is not in the trash 

#### `location`
Returns latitude and longitude as a tuple of floats (latitude, longitude).  If location is not set, latitude and longitude are returned as `None`

#### `place`
Returns a [PlaceInfo](#PlaceInfo) object with reverse geolocation data or None if there is the photo has no reverse geolocation information.

#### `shared`
Returns True if photo is in a shared album, otherwise False.

**Note**: *Only valid on Photos 5 / MacOS 10.15+; on Photos <= 4, returns None instead of True/False.

#### `comments`
Returns list of [CommentInfo](#commentinfo) objects for comments on shared photos or empty list if no comments.

**Note**: *Only valid on Photos 5 / MacOS 10.15+; on Photos <= 4, returns empty list.

#### `likes`
Returns list of [LikeInfo](#likeinfo) objects for likes on shared photos or empty list if no likes.

**Note**: *Only valid on Photos 5 / MacOS 10.15+; on Photos <= 4, returns empty list.

#### `isreference`
Returns `True` if the original image file is a referenced file (imported without copying to the Photos library) otherwise returns `False`.

#### `isphoto`
Returns True if type is photo/still image, otherwise False

#### `ismovie`
Returns True if type is movie/video, otherwise False

#### `iscloudasset`
Returns True if photo is a cloud asset, that is, it is in a library synched to iCloud.  See also [incloud](#incloud)

#### `incloud`
Returns True if photo is a [cloud asset](#iscloudasset) and is synched to iCloud otherwise False if photo is a cloud asset and not yet synched to iCloud. Returns None if photo is not a cloud asset.

**Note**: Applies to master (original) photo only.  It's possible for the master to be in iCloud but a local edited version is not yet synched to iCloud. `incloud` provides status of only the master photo.  osxphotos does not yet provide a means to determine if the edited version is in iCloud.  If you need this feature, please open an [issue](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/issues).

#### `uti`
Returns Uniform Type Identifier (UTI) for the current version of the image, for example: 'public.jpeg' or 'com.apple. quicktime-movie'.  If the image has been edited, `uti` will return the UTI for the edited image, otherwise it will return the UTI for the original image.

#### `uti_original`
Returns Uniform Type Identifier (UTI) for the original unedited image, for example: 'public.jpeg' or 'com.apple.quicktime-movie'.

#### `uti_edited`
Returns Uniform Type Identifier (UTI) for the edited image, for example: 'public.jpeg'.  Returns None if the photo does not have adjustments.

#### `uti_raw`
Returns Uniform Type Identifier (UTI) for the associated raw image, if there is one; for example, 'com.canon.cr2-raw-image'.  If the image is raw but not part of a RAW+JPEG pair, `uti_raw` returns None.  In this case, use `uti`, or `uti_original`.  See also [has_raw](#has_raw) and [notes on Raw Photos](#raw-photos).

#### `burst`
Returns True if photos is a burst image (e.g. part of a set of burst images), otherwise False.
See [burst_photos](#burst_photos)

#### `burst_photos`
If photo is a burst image (see [burst](#burst)), returns a list of PhotoInfo objects for all other photos in the same burst set. If not a burst image, returns empty list.

Example below gets list of all photos that are bursts, selects one of of them and prints out the names of the other images in the burst set.  PhotosDB.photos() will only return the photos in the burst set that the user [selected](https://support.apple.com/guide/photos/view-photo-bursts-phtde06a275d/mac) using "Make a Selection..." in Photos or the key image Photos selected if the user has not yet made a selection.  This is similar to how Photos displays and counts burst photos.  Using `burst_photos` you can access the other images in the burst set to export them, etc. 

```pycon
>>> import osxphotos
>>> photosdb = osxphotos.PhotosDB("/Users/smith/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary")
>>> bursts = [p for p in photosdb.photos() if p.burst]
>>> burst_photo = bursts[5]
>>> len(burst_photo.burst_photos)
4
>>> burst_photo.original_filename
'IMG_9851.JPG'
>>> for photo in burst_photo.burst_photos:
...     print(photo.original_filename)
...
IMG_9853.JPG
IMG_9852.JPG
IMG_9854.JPG
IMG_9855.JPG
```

#### `live_photo`
Returns True if photo is an Apple live photo (ie. it has an associated "live" video component), otherwise returns False.  See [path_live_photo](#path_live_photo).

#### `path_live_photo`
Returns the path to the live video component of a [live photo](#live_photo). If photo is not a live photo, returns None.

**Note**: will also return None if the live video component is missing on disk. It's possible that the original photo may be on disk ([ismissing](#ismissing)==False) but the video component is missing, likely because it has not been downloaded from iCloud.

#### `portrait`
Returns True if photo was taken in iPhone portrait mode, otherwise False.

#### `hdr`
Returns True if photo was taken in High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode, otherwise False.

#### `selfie`
Returns True if photo is a selfie (taken with front-facing camera), otherwise False.  

**Note**: Only implemented for Photos version 3.0+.  On Photos version < 3.0, returns None.

#### `time_lapse`
Returns True if photo is a time lapse video, otherwise False.

#### `panorama`
Returns True if photo is a panorama, otherwise False.

**Note**: The result of `PhotoInfo.panorama` will differ from the "Panoramas" Media Types smart album in that it will also identify panorama photos from older phones that Photos does not recognize as panoramas. 

#### `slow_mo`
Returns True if photo is a slow motion video, otherwise False

#### `labels`
Returns image categorization labels associated with the photo as list of str.

**Note**: Only valid on Photos 5; on earlier versions, returns empty list. In Photos 5, Photos runs machine learning image categorization against photos in the library and automatically assigns labels to photos such as "People", "Dog", "Water", etc.  A photo may have zero or more labels associated with it.  See also [labels_normalized](#labels_normalized).  

#### `labels_normalized`
Returns image categorization labels associated with the photo as list of str. Labels are normalized (e.g. converted to lower case).  Use of normalized strings makes it easier to search if you don't how Apple capitalizes a label. For example:


```python
import osxphotos

photosdb = osxphotos.PhotosDB()
for photo in photosdb.photos():
    if "statue" in photo.labels_normalized:
        print(f"I found a statue! {photo.original_filename}")
```

**Note**: Only valid on Photos 5+; on earlier versions, returns empty list. In Photos 5+, Photos runs machine learning image categorization against photos in the library and automatically assigns labels to photos such as "People", "Dog", "Water", etc.  A photo may have zero or more labels associated with it.  See also [labels](#labels).  


#### <a name="photosearchinfo">`search_info`</a>
Returns [SearchInfo](#searchinfo) object that represents search metadata for the photo.  

**Note**: Only valid on Photos 5+; on ealier versions, returns None.

#### <a name="photosearchinfo-normalized">`search_info_normalized`</a>
Returns [SearchInfo](#searchinfo) object that represents normalized search metadata for the photo.  This returns a SearchInfo object just as `search_info` but all the properties of the object return normalized text (converted to lowercase).

**Note**: Only valid on Photos 5+; on ealier versions, returns None.

#### `exif_info`
Returns an [ExifInfo](#exifinfo) object with EXIF details from the Photos database.  See [ExifInfo](#exifinfo) for additional details.

**Note**: Only valid on Photos 5+; on earlier versions, returns `None`.  The EXIF details returned are a subset of the actual EXIF data in a typical image.  At import Photos stores this subset in the database and it's this stored data that `exif_info` returns.

See also `exiftool`.

#### `exiftool`
Returns an ExifTool object for the photo which provides an interface to [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) allowing you to read or write the actual EXIF data in the image file inside the Photos library.  If [exif_info](#exif-info) doesn't give you all the data you need, you can use `exiftool` to read the entire EXIF contents of the image.

If the file is missing from the library (e.g. not downloaded from iCloud), returns None. 

exiftool must be installed in the path for this to work.  If exiftool cannot be found in the path, calling `exiftool` will log a warning and return `None`.  You can check the exiftool path using `osxphotos.exiftool.get_exiftool_path` which will raise FileNotFoundError if exiftool cannot be found.

```pycon
>>> import osxphotos
>>> osxphotos.exiftool.get_exiftool_path()
'/usr/local/bin/exiftool'
>>>
```

`ExifTool` provides the following methods:

- `asdict(tag_groups=True)`: returns all EXIF metadata found in the file as a dictionary in following form (Note: this shows just a subset of available metadata).  See [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) documentation to understand which metadata keys are available. If `tag_groups` is True (default) dict keys are in form "GROUP:TAG", e.g. "IPTC:Keywords". If `tag_groups` is False, dict keys do not have group names, e.g. "Keywords".

```python
{'Composite:Aperture': 2.2,
 'Composite:GPSPosition': '-34.9188916666667 138.596861111111',
 'Composite:ImageSize': '2754 2754',
 'EXIF:CreateDate': '2017:06:20 17:18:56',
 'EXIF:LensMake': 'Apple',
 'EXIF:LensModel': 'iPhone 6s back camera 4.15mm f/2.2',
 'EXIF:Make': 'Apple',
 'XMP:Title': 'Elder Park',
}
```

- `json()`: returns same information as `asdict()` but as a serialized JSON string.

- `setvalue(tag, value)`: write to the EXIF data in the photo file. To delete a tag, use setvalue with value = `None`. For example:
```python
photo.exiftool.setvalue("XMP:Title", "Title of photo")
```
- `addvalues(tag, *values)`: Add one or more value(s) to tag.  For a tag that accepts multiple values, like "IPTC:Keywords", this will add the values as additional list values.  However, for tags which are not usually lists, such as "EXIF:ISO" this will literally add the new value to the old value which is probably not the desired effect.  Be sure you understand the behavior of the individual tag before using this. For example:
```python
photo.exiftool.addvalues("IPTC:Keywords", "vacation", "beach")
```

**Caution**: I caution against writing new EXIF data to photos in the Photos library because this will overwrite the original copy of the photo and could adversely affect how Photos behaves.  `exiftool.asdict()` is useful for getting access to all the photos information but if you want to write new EXIF data, I recommend you export the photo first then write the data.  [PhotoInfo.export()](#export) does this if called with `exiftool=True`.

#### `score`
Returns a [ScoreInfo](#scoreinfo) data class object which provides access to the computed aesthetic scores for each photo.

**Note**: Valid only for Photos 5; returns None for earlier Photos versions.

#### `json()`
Returns a JSON representation of all photo info.

#### `asdict()`
Returns a dictionary representation of all photo info.

#### `export()`
`export(dest, *filename, edited=False, live_photo=False, export_as_hardlink=False, overwrite=False, increment=True, sidecar_json=False, sidecar_exiftool=False, sidecar_xmp=False, use_photos_export=False, timeout=120, exiftool=False, use_albums_as_keywords=False, use_persons_as_keywords=False)`

Export photo from the Photos library to another destination on disk.  
- dest: must be valid destination path as str (or exception raised).
- *filename (optional): name of picture as str; if not provided, will use current filename.  **NOTE**: if provided, user must ensure file extension (suffix) is correct. For example, if photo is .CR2 file, edited image may be .jpeg.  If you provide an extension different than what the actual file is, export will print a warning but will happily export the photo using the incorrect file extension.  e.g. to get the extension of the edited photo, look at [PhotoInfo.path_edited](#path_edited).
- edited: boolean; if True (default=False), will export the edited version of the photo (or raise exception if no edited version)
- export_as_hardlink: boolean; if True (default=False), will hardlink files instead of copying them
- overwrite: boolean; if True (default=False), will overwrite files if they alreay exist
- live_photo: boolean; if True (default=False), will also export the associted .mov for live photos; exported live photo will be named filename.mov
- increment: boolean; if True (default=True), will increment file name until a non-existent name is found
- sidecar_json: (boolean, default = False); if True will also write a json sidecar with metadata in format readable by exiftool; sidecar filename will be dest/filename.json where filename is the stem of the photo name
- sidecar_json: (boolean, default = False); if True will also write a json sidecar with metadata in format readable by exiftool; sidecar filename will be dest/filename.json where filename is the stem of the photo name; resulting json file will include tag group names (e.g. `exiftool -G -j`)
- sidecar_exiftool: (boolean, default = False); if True will also write a json sidecar with metadata in format readable by exiftool; sidecar filename will be dest/filename.json where filename is the stem of the photo name; resulting json file will not include tag group names (e.g. `exiftool -j`)
- sidecar_xmp: (boolean, default = False); if True will also write a XMP sidecar with metadata; sidecar filename will be dest/filename.xmp where filename is the stem of the photo name
- use_photos_export: boolean; (default=False), if True will attempt to export photo via applescript interaction with Photos; useful for forcing download of missing photos.  This only works if the Photos library being used is the default library (last opened by Photos) as applescript will directly interact with whichever library Photos is currently using.
- timeout: (int, default=120) timeout in seconds used with use_photos_export
- exiftool: (boolean, default = False) if True, will use [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) to write metadata directly to the exported photo; exiftool must be installed and in the system path
- use_albums_as_keywords: (boolean, default = False); if True, will use album names as keywords when exporting metadata with exiftool or sidecar
- use_persons_as_keywords: (boolean, default = False); if True, will use person names as keywords when exporting metadata with exiftool or sidecar

Returns: list of paths to exported files. More than one file could be exported, for example if live_photo=True, both the original image and the associated .mov file will be exported

The json sidecar file can be used by exiftool to apply the metadata from the json file to the image.  For example: 

```python
import osxphotos

photosdb = osxphotos.PhotosDB("/Users/smith/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary")
photos = photosdb.photos()
photos[0].export("/tmp","photo_name.jpg",sidecar_json=True)
```

Then

`exiftool -j=photo_name.json photo_name.jpg`

If overwrite=False and increment=False, export will fail if destination file already exists


#### <a name="rendertemplate">`render_template()`</a>

`render_template(template_str, none_str = "_", path_sep = None, expand_inplace = False, inplace_sep = None, filename=False, dirname=False, strip=False)`

Render template string for photo.  none_str is used if template substitution results in None value and no default specified.

- `template_str`: str in osxphotos template language (OTL) format. See also [Template Substitutions](#template-substitutions) table. See notes below regarding specific details of the syntax.
- `none_str`: optional str to use as substitution when template value is None and no default specified in the template string.  default is "_".
- `path_sep`: optional character to use as path separator when joining path like fields such as `{folder_album}`; default is `os.path.sep`.  May also be provided in the template itself. If provided both in the call to `render_template()` and in the template itself, the value in the template string takes precedence.
- `expand_inplace`: expand multi-valued substitutions in-place as a single string instead of returning individual strings
- `inplace_sep`: optional string to use as separator between multi-valued keywords with expand_inplace; default is ','
- `filename`: if True, template output will be sanitized to produce valid file name
- `dirname`: if True, template output will be sanitized to produce valid directory name
- `strip`: if True, leading/trailign whitespace will be stripped from rendered template strings

Returns a tuple of (rendered, unmatched) where rendered is a list of rendered strings with all substitutions made and unmatched is a list of any strings that resembled a template substitution but did not match a known substitution. E.g. if template contained "{foo}", unmatched would be ["foo"].  If there are unmatched strings, rendered will be [].  E.g. a template statement must fully match or will result in error and return all unmatched fields in unmatched.

e.g. `render_template("{created.year}/{foo}", photo)` would return `([],["foo"])`

Some substitutions, notably `album`, `keyword`, and `person` could return multiple values, hence a new string will be return for each possible substitution (hence why a list of rendered strings is returned).  For example, a photo in 2 albums: 'Vacation' and 'Family' would result in the following rendered values if template was "{created.year}/{album}" and created.year == 2020: `["2020/Vacation","2020/Family"]` 

<!-- OSXPHOTOS-TEMPLATE-HELP:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->
The templating system converts one or template statements, written in osxphotos templating language, to one or more rendered values using information from the photo being processed. 

In its simplest form, a template statement has the form: `"{template_field}"`, for example `"{title}"` which would resolve to the title of the photo.

Template statements may contain one or more modifiers.  The full syntax is:

`"pretext{delim+template_field:subfield|filter(path_sep)[find,replace]?bool_value,default}posttext"`

Template statements are white-space sensitive meaning that white space (spaces, tabs) changes the meaning of the template statement.

`pretext` and `posttext` are free form text.  For example, if a photo has title "My Photo Title". the template statement `"The title of the photo is {title}"`, resolves to `"The title of the photo is My Photo Title"`.  The `pretext` in this example is `"The title if the photo is "` and the template_field is `{title}`.  


`delim`: optional delimiter string to use when expanding multi-valued template values in-place

`+`: If present before template `name`, expands the template in place.  If `delim` not provided, values are joined with no delimiter.

e.g. if Photo keywords are `["foo","bar"]`:

- `"{keyword}"` renders to `"foo", "bar"`
- `"{,+keyword}"` renders to: `"foo,bar"`
- `"{; +keyword}"` renders to: `"foo; bar"`
- `"{+keyword}"` renders to `"foobar"`

`template_field`: The template field to resolve.  See [Template Substitutions](#template-substitutions) for full list of template fields. 

`:subfield`: Some templates have sub-fields, For example, `{exiftool:IPTC:Make}`; the template_field is `exiftool` and the sub-field is `IPTC:Make`.

`|filter`: You may optionally append one or more filter commands to the end of the template field using the vertical pipe ('|') symbol.  Filters may be combined, separated by '|' as in: `{keyword|capitalize|parens}`.

Valid filters are:

<!-- OSXPHOTOS-FILTER-TABLE:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->
- lower: Convert value to lower case, e.g. 'Value' => 'value'.
- upper: Convert value to upper case, e.g. 'Value' => 'VALUE'.
- strip: Strip whitespace from beginning/end of value, e.g. ' Value ' => 'Value'.
- titlecase: Convert value to title case, e.g. 'my value' => 'My Value'.
- capitalize: Capitalize first word of value and convert other words to lower case, e.g. 'MY VALUE' => 'My value'.
- braces: Enclose value in curly braces, e.g. 'value => '{value}'.
- parens: Enclose value in parentheses, e.g. 'value' => '(value')
- brackets: Enclose value in brackets, e.g. 'value' => '[value]'
<!-- OSXPHOTOS-FILTER-TABLE:END -->

e.g. if Photo keywords are `["FOO","bar"]`:

- `"{keyword|lower}"` renders to `"foo", "bar"`
- `"{keyword|upper}"` renders to: `"FOO", "BAR"`
- `"{keyword|capitalize}"` renders to: `"Foo", "Bar"`
- `"{keyword|lower|parens}"` renders to: `"(foo)", "(bar)"`

e.g. if Photo description is "my description":

- `"{descr|titlecase}"` renders to: `"My Description"`

`(path_sep)`: optional path separator to use when joining path-like fields, for example `{folder_album}`.  Default is "/".

e.g. If Photo is in `Album1` in `Folder1`:

- `"{folder_album}"` renders to `["Folder1/Album1"]`
- `"{folder_album(>)}"` renders to `["Folder1>Album1"]`
- `"{folder_album()}"` renders to `["Folder1Album1"]`

`[find|replace]`: optional text replacement to perform on rendered template value.  For example, to replace "/" in an album name, you could use the template `"{album[/,-]}"`.  Multiple replacements can be made by appending "|" and adding another find|replace pair.  e.g. to replace both "/" and ":" in album name: `"{album[/,-|:,-]}"`.  find/replace pairs are not limited to single characters.  The "|" character cannot be used in a find/replace pair.

`?bool_value`: Template fields may be evaluated as boolean by appending "?" after the field name (and following "(path_sep)" or "[find/replace]".  If a field is True (e.g. photo is HDR and field is `"{hdr}"`) or has any value, the value following the "?" will be used to render the template instead of the actual field value.  If the template field evaluates to False (e.g. in above example, photo is not HDR) or has no value (e.g. photo has no title and field is `"{title}"`) then the default value following a "," will be used.  

e.g. if photo is an HDR image,

- `"{hdr?ISHDR,NOTHDR}"` renders to `"ISHDR"`

and if it is not an HDR image,

- `"{hdr?ISHDR,NOTHDR}"` renders to `"NOTHDR"`

`,default`: optional default value to use if the template name has no value.  This modifier is also used for the value if False for boolean-type fields (see above) as well as to hold a sub-template for values like `{created.strftime}`.  If no default value provided, "_" is used. 

e.g., if photo has no title set,

- `"{title}"` renders to "_"
- `"{title,I have no title}"` renders to `"I have no title"`

Template fields such as `created.strftime` use the default value to pass the template to use for `strftime`.  

e.g., if photo date is 4 February 2020, 19:07:38,

- `"{created.strftime,%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S}"` renders to `"2020-02-04-190738"`

Some template fields such as `"{media_type}"` use the default value to allow customization of the output. For example, `"{media_type}"` resolves to the special media type of the photo such as `panorama` or `selfie`.  You may use the default value to override these in form: `"{media_type,video=vidéo;time_lapse=vidéo_accélérée}"`. In this example, if photo was a time_lapse photo, `media_type` would resolve to `vidéo_accélérée` instead of `time_lapse`. 

Either or both bool_value or default (False value) may be empty which would result in empty string `""` when rendered.

If you want to include "{" or "}" in the output, use "{openbrace}" or "{closebrace}" template substitution.

e.g. `"{created.year}/{openbrace}{title}{closebrace}"` would result in `"2020/{Photo Title}"`.

#### `parent`
Returns a [FolderInfo](#FolderInfo) object representing the folder's parent folder or `None` if album is not a in a folder.

**Note**: FolderInfo and AlbumInfo objects effectively work as a linked list.  The children of a folder are contained in `subfolders` and `album_info` and the parent object of both `AlbumInfo` and `FolderInfo` is represented by `parent`.  For example:

```pycon
>>> import osxphotos
>>> photosdb = osxphotos.PhotosDB()
>>> photosdb.folder_info
[<osxphotos.albuminfo.FolderInfo object at 0x10fcc0160>]
>>> photosdb.folder_info[0].title
'Folder1'
>>> photosdb.folder_info[0].subfolders[1].title
'SubFolder2'
>>> photosdb.folder_info[0].subfolders[1].album_info[0].title
'AlbumInFolder'
>>> photosdb.folder_info[0].subfolders[1].album_info[0].parent.title
'SubFolder2'
>>> photosdb.folder_info[0].subfolders[1].album_info[0].parent.album_info[0].title
'AlbumInFolder'
```


### PlaceInfo
[PhotoInfo.place](#place) returns a PlaceInfo object if the photo contains valid reverse geolocation information.  PlaceInfo has the following properties.  

**Note** For Photos versions <= 4, only `name`, `names`, and `country_code` properties are defined.  All others return `None`.  This is because older versions of Photos do not store the more detailed reverse geolocation information.

#### `ishome`
Returns `True` if photo place is user's home address, otherwise `False`.

#### `name`
Returns the name of the local place as str.  This is what Photos displays in the Info window.  **Note** Photos 5 uses a different algorithm to determine the name than earlier versions which means the same Photo may have a different place name in Photos 4 and Photos 5. `PhotoInfo.name` will return the name Photos would have shown depending on the version of the library being processed.  In Photos 5, the place name is generally more detailed than in earlier versions of Photos.

For example, I have photo in my library that under Photos 4, has place name of "‎⁨Mayfair Shopping Centre⁩, ⁨Victoria⁩, ⁨Canada⁩" and under Photos 5 the same photo has place name of "Mayfair⁩, ⁨Vancouver Island⁩, ⁨Victoria⁩, ⁨British Columbia⁩, ⁨Canada⁩".

Returns `None` if photo does not contain a name.

#### `names`
Returns a `PlaceNames` namedtuple with the following fields.  Each field is a list with zero or more values, sorted by area in ascending order.  E.g. `names.area_of_interest` could be ['Gulf Islands National Seashore', 'Santa Rosa Island'], ["Knott's Berry Farm"], or [] if `area_of_interest` not defined.  The value shown in Photos is the first value in the list. With the exception of `body_of_water` each of these field corresponds to an attribute of a [CLPlacemark](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/clplacemark) object.  **Note** The `PlaceNames` namedtuple contains reserved fields not listed below (see implementation for details), thus it should be referenced only by name (e.g. `names.city`) and not by index.

- `country`; the name of the country associated with the placemark.
- `state_province`; administrativeArea, The state or province associated with the placemark.
- `sub_administrative_area`; additional administrative area information for the placemark.
- `city`; locality; the city associated with the placemark.
- `additional_city_info`; subLocality, Additional city-level information for the placemark.
- `ocean`; the name of the ocean associated with the placemark.
- `area_of_interest`; areasOfInterest, The relevant areas of interest associated with the placemark.
- `inland_water`; the name of the inland water body associated with the placemark.
- `region`; the geographic region associated with the placemark.
- `sub_throughfare`; additional street-level information for the placemark.
- `postal_code`; the postal code associated with the placemark.
- `street_address`; throughfare, The street address associated with the placemark.
- `body_of_water`; in Photos 4, any body of water; in Photos 5 contains the union of ocean and inland_water

**Note**: In Photos <= 4.0, only the following fields are defined; all others are set to empty list:

- `country`
- `state_province`
- `sub_administrative_area`
- `city` 
- `additional_city_info`
- `area_of_interest`
- `body_of_water`

#### `country_code`
Returns the country_code of place, for example "GB".  Returns `None` if PhotoInfo contains no country code.

#### `address_str`
Returns the full postal address as a string if defined, otherwise `None`.

For example: "2038 18th St NW, Washington, DC  20009, United States"

#### `address`:
Returns a `PostalAddress` namedtuple with details of the postal address containing the following fields:
- `city`
- `country`
- `postal_code`
- `state`
- `street`
- `sub_administrative_area`
- `sub_locality`
- `iso_country_code`

For example:
```pycon
>>> photo.place.address
PostalAddress(street='3700 Wailea Alanui Dr', sub_locality=None, city='Kihei', sub_administrative_area='Maui', state='HI', postal_code='96753', country='United States', iso_country_code='US')
>>> photo.place.address.postal_code
'96753'
```

### Raw Photos
Handling raw photos in `osxphotos` requires a bit of extra work.  Raw photos in Photos can be imported in two different ways: 1) a single raw photo with no associated JPEG image is imported 2) a raw+JPEG pair is imported -- two separate images with same file stem (e.g. `IMG_0001.CR2` and `IMG_001.JPG`) are imported.  

The latter are treated by Photos as a single image.  By default, Photos will treat these as a JPEG image.  They are denoted in the Photos interface with a "J" icon superimposed on the image.  In Photos, the user can select "Use RAW as original" in which case the "J" icon changes to an "R" icon and all subsequent edits will use the raw image as the original. To further complicate this, different versions of Photos handle these differently in their internal logic.  

`osxphotos` attempts to simplify the handling of these raw+JPEG pairs by providing a set of attributes for accessing both the JPEG and the raw version.  For example, [PhotoInfo.has_raw](#has_raw) will be True if the photo has an associated raw image but False otherwise and [PhotoInfo.path_raw](#path_raw) provides the path to the associated raw image.  Reference the following table for the various attributes useful for dealing with raw images.  Given the different ways Photos deals with raw images I've struggled with how to represent these in a logical and consistent manner.  If you have suggestions for a better interface, please open an [issue](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/issues)!

#### Raw-Related Attributes 

|`PhotoInfo` attribute|`IMG_0001.CR2` imported without raw+JPEG pair|`IMG_0001.CR2` + `IMG_0001.JPG` raw+JPEG pair, JPEG is original|`IMG_0001.CR2` + `IMG_0001.JPG` raw+jpeg pair, raw is original|
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|[israw](#israw)| True | False | False |
|[has_raw](#has_raw)| False | True | True |
|[uti](#uti) | `com.canon.cr2-raw-image` | `public.jpeg` | `public.jpeg` |
|[uti_raw](#uti_raw) | None | `com.canon.cr2-raw-image` | `com.canon.cr2-raw-image` |
|[raw_original](#raw_original) | False | False | True |
|[path](#path) | `/path/to/IMG_0001.CR2` | `/path/to/IMG_0001.JPG` | `/path/to/IMG_0001.JPG` |
|[path_raw](#path_raw) | None | `/path/to/IMG_0001.CR2` | `/path/to/IMG_0001.CR2` | 

#### Example
To get the path of every raw photo, whether it's a single raw photo or a raw+JPEG pair, one could do something like this:

```pycon
>>> import osxphotos
>>> photosdb = osxphotos.PhotosDB()
>>> photos = photosdb.photos()
>>> all_raw = [p for p in photos if p.israw or p.has_raw]
>>> for raw in all_raw:
...     path = raw.path if raw.israw else raw.path_raw
...     print(path)
```

Returns list of Photos libraries found on the system.  **Note**: On MacOS 10.15, this appears to list all libraries. On older systems, it may not find some libraries if they are not located in ~/Pictures.  Provided for convenience but do not rely on this to find all libraries on the system.

#### `dd_to_dms_str(lat, lon)`
Convert latitude, longitude in degrees to degrees, minutes, seconds as string.
- `lat`: latitude in degrees
- `lon`: longitude in degrees
returns: string tuple in format ("51 deg 30' 12.86\\" N", "0 deg 7' 54.50\\" W")
This is the same format used by exiftool's json format.


## Examples

```python
import osxphotos

def main():

    photosdb = osxphotos.PhotosDB("/Users/smith/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary")
    print(f"db file = {photosdb.db_path}")
    print(f"db version = {photosdb.db_version}")

    print(photosdb.keywords)
    print(photosdb.persons)
    print(photosdb.album_names)

    print(photosdb.keywords_as_dict)
    print(photosdb.persons_as_dict)
    print(photosdb.albums_as_dict)

    # find all photos with Keyword = Kids and containing person Katie
    photos = photosdb.photos(keywords=["Kids"], persons=["Katie"])
    print(f"found {len(photos)} photos")

    # find all photos that include Katie but do not contain the keyword wedding
    photos = [
        p
        for p in photosdb.photos(persons=["Katie"])
        if p not in photosdb.photos(keywords=["wedding"])
    ]

    # get all photos in the database
    photos = photosdb.photos()
    for p in photos:
        print(
            p.uuid,
            p.filename,
            p.date,
            p.description,
            p.title,
            p.keywords,
            p.albums,
            p.persons,
            p.path,
            p.ismissing,
            p.hasadjustments,
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Related Projects

- [rhettbull/photosmeta](https://github.com/rhettbull/photosmeta): uses osxphotos and [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) to apply metadata from Photos as exif data in the photo files.  Can also export photos while preserving metadata and also apply Photos keywords as spotlight tags to make it easier to search for photos using spotlight.  This is mostly made obsolete by osxphotos.  The one feature that photosmeta has that osxphotos does not is ability to update the metadata of the actual photo files in the Photos library without exporting them. (Use with caution!)

## Contributing

Contributing is easy!  if you find bugs or want to suggest additional features/changes, please open an [issue](https://github.com/rhettbull/osxphotos/issues/) or join the [discussion](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/discussions).

I'll gladly consider pull requests for bug fixes or feature implementations.  

If you have an interesting example that shows usage of this package, submit an issue or pull request and i'll include it or link to it.

Testing against "real world" Photos libraries would be especially helpful.  If you discover issues in testing against your Photos libraries, please open an issue.  I've done extensive testing against my own Photos library but that's a since data point and I'm certain there are issues lurking in various edge cases I haven't discovered yet.

## Known Bugs

My goal is make osxphotos as reliable and comprehensive as possible.  The test suite currently has over 800 tests--but there are still some [bugs](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) or incomplete features lurking.  If you find bugs please open an [issue](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/issues).  Please consult the list of open bugs before deciding that you want to use this code on your Photos library.  Notable issues include:

- Image orientation is not always correct for photos rotated in Photos.app.  See [Issue #379](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/issues/379).
- Face coordinates (mouth, left eye, right eye) may not be correct for images where the head is tilted.  See [Issue #196](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/issues/196).
- Raw images imported to Photos with an associated jpeg preview are not handled correctly by osxphotos.  osxphotos query and export will operate on the jpeg preview instead of the raw image as will `PhotoInfo.path`.  If the user selects "Use RAW as original" in Photos, the raw image will be exported or operated on but the jpeg will be ignored.  See [Issue #101](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/issues/101). Note: Beta version of fix for this bug is implemented in the current version of osxphotos.
- The `--download-missing` option for `osxphotos export` does not work correctly with burst images.  It will download the primary image but not the other burst images.  See [Issue #75](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/issues/75).

## Implementation Notes

This package works by creating a copy of the sqlite3 database that photos uses to store data about the photos library. The class PhotosDB then queries this database to extract information about the photos such as persons (faces identified in the photos), albums, keywords, etc.  If your library is large, the database can be hundreds of MB in size and the copy read then  can take many 10s of seconds to complete.  Once copied, the entire database is processed and an in-memory data structure is created meaning all subsequent accesses of the PhotosDB object occur much more quickly. 

If apple changes the database format this will likely break.

For additional details about how osxphotos is implemented or if you would like to extend the code, see the [wiki](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos/wiki).

## Acknowledgements
This project was originally inspired by [photo-export](https://github.com/patrikhson/photo-export) by Patrick Fältström,  Copyright (c) 2015 Patrik Fältström paf@frobbit.se

I use [py-applescript](https://github.com/rdhyee/py-applescript) by "Raymond Yee / rdhyee" to interact with Photos. Rather than import this package, I included the entire package (which is published as public domain code) in a private package to prevent ambiguity with other applescript packages on PyPi. py-applescript uses a native bridge via PyObjC and is very fast compared to the other osascript based packages.
